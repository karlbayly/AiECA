    <p>Building Blocks / Breaking Rocks (2018) draws on the knowledge, expertise and practices oftwo artists/educators/teachers working in collaboration with a group of children from twolocal primary schools where, for one reason or another, an art oriented pedagogy is supported and enabled to flourish.</p>
 
    <p>For one artist/educator, art emerges be- cause of the school structures that provide resources (including the employment of a qualified artist/educator) for children, across the school, who reveal an interest in art to participate in regular art learning experiences.</p>

    <p>For the other qualified artist/teacher, art is an identifiable learning area, noted on the weekly programme in anticipation that all children in attendance in that class will engage, with art, its makings.</p>
  
  	<img src="Images/fill.png" alt="">
  
  
    <p>Building Blocks / Breaking Rocks (2018) positions children’s art works, once again, outside of education, in the public world of art.</p>

    <p>This positioning can be understood as an act of aesthetic experimentation with places where traditionally still dominant somewhat hierarchical, if not mythical,categorisations easily prevail: artist/audience, art/pedagogy, art/education-education/art, teacher/ student, adult/child, nature/nurture. It is anticipated that this exhibition-making act(ivism) will contribute to a disruption of the restrictive discourses that inform a knowledge of child, and/or other, identities and the easy categorisations that persist...</p>

    <p>A collective assemblage of desire: “...is not an individual feature, but rather a feature of the ‘pack’. We exist in ‘packs’ and we do unconsciously. We... must avoid all attempts to ‘speak for the other’ ...in favour of focusing the ...childhood milieu and the staging of places where collective assemblages of desire can construct themselves in unexpected not yet defined ways (Olsson, Dhalberg & Theorell, 2016, p. 736).</p>

    <p>Both building and breaking are construction site activities, blocks and rocks are construc- tionsite tools – these activities and tools are synonymous with childhood.</p>

    <p>We are hopeful that positioning children’s art work in the gallery, a site where art is staged, culture and knowledge are produced, contributes something to constructing spaces that are capable of contesting and offering alternative child- identity discourses, ones that enable the milieu of childhood, of children, to be immersed in the wholeness of that which they/we are studying –art, life?</p>

    <p>As a result, it is expected that the child- art practices that emerge inside/outside education develop a capacity to widen the engaging (with) art offerings available to and with children – and others in their lives. Chil- dren, their families, art, artists, teachers, and educators, as a result, will experience a greater sense of knowing art and the aesthetic agency art, its makings, offer - in much more than ‘nice to have’ ways, but rather in complex ways that are recognised as integral and inseparable parts of what it means to be child, human.</p>
